This is the backend to a lazily evaluated LexicalAnalyzer. I make no claims
that it works perfectly. Use the Tycho library as a premade front end to this
library. Otherwise you will have to write it all from scratch

You will need the Extensions and Collections libraries as this library depends
on them.
